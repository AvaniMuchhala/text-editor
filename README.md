# Text Editor

## Description

J.A.T.E. is Just Another Text Editor that runs in the browser and can also function offline. This text editor can be used to create and store notes or code snippets regardless of whether you are connected to the Internet so that you can retrieve these notes for later use. I built this project to learn how to use a web manifest for installability, service workers and cache API for offline functionality, and indexedDB for client-side data persistance in order to transform the given application into a progressive web application (PWA).

## Usage

Click on the URL to use the app:

On the website, add content to the text editor. After entering content, click somewhere else not in the text editor to ensure the content gets automatically saved. You can also either click on the "Install Me!" button or the install icon in the search bar to download the web app to your desktop.
